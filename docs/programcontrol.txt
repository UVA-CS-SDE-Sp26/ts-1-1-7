Program Control
------------------
Tasks:
- Connect the command-line inputs (A) to file handler (B)
    - Request file contents and return readable text
- Program executed with no arguments: Return a list of files available (From B)
- Apply deciphering (From D)
Print either:
  (a) numbered list of available files (no args)
  (b) contents of selected file (one or two args)
  (c) error message, then exit
-------------------
Pseudocode:
Get list of files from FileHandler

if args.length == 0:
    printFileList(files)
    exit
if 1 or 2 args:
    Check fileID is valid (01, 02, etc.)
    if invalid:
        Print error
        Print file list
        exit
    filename = files[fileID number]
    text = read file (filename)

    if 2 args:
        key = args[1]
    else:
        key = default key

    text = Deciphered text with key (D)
    print text
    exit

end
